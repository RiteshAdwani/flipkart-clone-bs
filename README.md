## Tools Used:
- HTML : For structuring the content of the webpage.
- CSS : To add styling to few components.
- Bootstrap : To style most of the components of the webpage.
- Google Fonts : To ensure that the font works the same on all browsers.

## Bootstrap:
- Bootstrap is a powerful front-end framework that is used to style the components of your webpage effortlessly.
- Bootstrap has built-in classes for styling components.
- Unlike CSS, here we don't write specific rules for styling components.
- Instead, we just add class names to the `class` property of a particular component that we want to style.
- Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs.

## How to add Bootstrap to your project:

- You can download Bootstrap on this link : https://getbootstrap.com/
- Or you can use the CDN :
Just add the code snippet in the `head` section of your html code
